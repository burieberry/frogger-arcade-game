# Frogger Arcade Game
===============================

Here's the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for the submissino.

Objective of this project is to write **object-oriented** Javascript code - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`, and using the keyword `'this'` appropriately within the class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## How to Play

- The goal of the Player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the Enemy Bugs.
- Use up, down, right, and left keys to move the Player.
- If the Player collides with an Enemy Bug, the game is reset and Player is back to starting position.
- Once the Player reaches the water the game is won.
